/**
 * @Description
 *
 * Memory safer implementation of android.os.Handler
 * Original implementation of Handlers always keeps hard reference to handler in queue of execution.
 * If you create anonymous handler and post delayed message into it, it will keep all self class
 * for that time in memory even if it could be cleaned.
 * This implementation is trickier, it will keep WeakReferences to runnables and messages,
 * and GC could collect them once WeakHandler instance is not referenced any more

 * android.os.Handler的内存安全实现处理程序的原始实现总是在执行队列中保持对处理程序的硬引用。
 * 如果你创建匿名处理器并向它发送延迟消息，它将保留所有的self类记忆中的那段时间，即使它可以被清除。这个实现比较棘手，它会将WeakReferences保存为可运行对象和消息，一旦WeakHandler实例不再被引用，GC就会收集它们
